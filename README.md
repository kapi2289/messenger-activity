# Messenger Activity

## ADDON REMOVED
Facebook doesn't provide the information about conversations enters anymore, so I need to remove this addon. I'm leaving this repository archived. Thanks!

## Description
When someone enters a conversation with you on Messenger from a mobile phone, their profile image will have a red border.
